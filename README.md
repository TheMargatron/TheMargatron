Hello, welcome to my PhD homepage. I am Margaret Bolton and am most of the way through my [Environmental Intelligence](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/eicdt/) PhD at the University of Exeter, supervised by the marvellous [Regan Early](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Regan_Early) and excellent [Abraham Kuijper](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Bram_Kuijper). To give you a quick background, I completed my BSc in Ecology at the University of Edinburgh, did a conservation internship with the RSPB at Otmoor, then finished my MSc with a first class degree in Applied Ecology at the University of Exeter where I first met my two current supervisors. I like to take an interdisciplinary approach to research so have fitted in well at the EI CDT. Their core goal is to unite different fields of research to solve environmental problems through the application of AI and data science. The common threads in my research interests are biotic interactions, biogeography, theoretical ecology, and the application of novel research methods. Alongside my PhD I have provided coding support to undergraduates in their final year, contributed to an AI-centred art exhibition, taught a crochet workshop, and supported the running of the EI CDT Art Lab.

## Publications and talks
The Bayesian data analysis I did for my undergraduate thesis contributed to this paper on blue tit biogeography:

I gave an engaging and well received pick-your-own-adventure style talk on my evolutionary research at the 28th EMPSEB conference. I have also delivered many other presentations, including at the Macro-ecology SIG conference in 2018 and the Symposium on Ecological and Evolutionary drivers of pathogen emergence. 

I was invited to give a radio interview in the lead up to the British Science Festival in 2023 with Heart Devon, followed by a second on ABC's Science Show with Robyn Williams.
